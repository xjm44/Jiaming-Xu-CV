Same as softwareV2, I used c++, opengl, qt and pcl for making this software.
For the opengl part, I used Easy3D (https://github.com/LiangliangNan/Easy3D) which is the work from Professor Liangliang Nan. 

The difference from V2 is that the GUI has improved greatly, as well as the structure of the coding and the design patterns within.
More functions, such as the pre-work for process the data and the tools for post-process the data, are added according to clients' needs.
