I used three video clips ('home.mov', 'school.mov', 'playground.mov') for my backgrounds/events.
I stored their frames into three different folders: 'homeframes', 'pgframes', 'schframes'.

I used three images for the characters: Sam ('boy.jpg'), Cat ('cat.jpg'), Monster ('monster.jpg').

For the monkey, I get its frames first and stored them inside a folder, 'monkey'.
Then, I replace the monkey (5 key coordinates) with the boy in every frame and stored it inside a folder, 'monkey123'.

At last, after composite everything (3 characters and the 3 backgrounds), I stored the frames inside a folder,'testzz'. And generate the final video, 'result.mov', using 'testzz'.

Due to the random behaviours of the characters, the final video will be different with respect to each composition of the frames.
